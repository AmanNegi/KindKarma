## Inspiration
Many of us want to get involved in volunteering activities but we are not sure how to go about in doing it. Finding volunteer events can be quite a hassle as it takes so much time and researching. This inspired us to create KindKarma, a mobile and web platform that makes it easier to have a positive impact in your community through volunteering. 

## What it does
The user can use either the mobile app or web platform. They can create an account or sign in to an existing account and they can find volunteer events. They can also host events as well as interact with other people in the community. Our purpose with this project is to bring people together to make a positive impact that will make a small difference in the world.

## How we built it
- Design: Figma
- Frontend: Chakra UI, React JS, Tailwind CSS
- App: Flutter
- Backend: Node JS, MongoDB Atlas, Twilio, Socket.io
